creatingScheduleHelp=\
  Create a schedule of your planned trips.<br>\
  <br>\
  A schedule consists of one or more entries and each entry consists of \
  a date span and the number of coupons required per day.<br>\
  <br>\
  Start by creating the first entry.


selectingDateSpan=\
  Select date span

selectingDateSpanHelp=\
  You must select a start date from the left panel and an end date from the right panel.

selectingCoupons=\
  Select number of coupons

selectingCouponsHelp=\
  Enter the number of coupons needed for one day of traveling. \
  The number of coupons depends both on the number of trips and how many zones are visited.<br>\
  <br>\
  You can enter the number of coupons per day for the entire week and then \
  make adjustments for individual days of the week.<br>\
  <br>\
  Visit SL:s website for more information on the zone system and \
  the number of coupons needed for various strips.<br>\
  <br>\
  <b>Example:</b> You reside in zone B and work in zone A. You need <b>3</b> coupons per trip. \
  You make <b>2</b> trips per day and thus need <b>6</b> coupons per day. \
  Since this only applies to monday to friday you select <b>0</b> for saturday and sunday.

  The result view is a suggestion of tickets to purchase to be able to travel according to the \
  schedule. \
  It is choosen as to make the travel as cheap as possible.<br>\
  <br>\
  You can deduce the start date of each ticket and when it expires.<br>\
  You will also see how much the ticket costs.<br>\
  If you need to buy more than one ticket, it will also show the total cost.

optimizeOptions=\
  Optimization

optimizeOptionsHelp=\
  There are two ways of calculating the cheapest cost.<br>\
  <br>\
  You can either consider only the days entered in the schedule, \
  which is the normal case if you know when you're going to take a longer travel break, \
  for instance during the vacation period.<br>\
  <br>\
  The other way is to also consider that you want to resume traveling \
  after the end of the schedule. A typical example is that you know you will continue traveling \
  to work from monday to friday, but are uncertain as to exactly when the next vacation is.<br>\
  With this option selected the program will consider both the days in the schedule and \
  the following days according to the provided coupon setting.
